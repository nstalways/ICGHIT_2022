**A Research Project Aimed at Removing Music from a Mixed Spoken and Music Signal**<br>

## Abstract
In this paper, we discuss a study that used the SuDo Rm-Rf model to remove music from a mixed speech and music signal, which showed satisfactory results in audio source separation. The performance of the SuDo Rm -Rf model was measured by separating a mixed speech and music signal, where we updated some parts of the original model to increase performance based on the experimental results. When the modified model and the original model were compared throught the experiment, it was confirmed that the SI-SDR value was imporved and the quality when listening to the signal reconstructed by the model was improved.
